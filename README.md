# Coffee Shop Web Application – CSIS 3275 Project

This project was developed by a team of four students as part of the **CSIS 3275 – Software Engineering** course at **Douglas College** during the **Fall 2024** semester.

It is a simple **web application for a coffee shop**, designed using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture**. The technology stack includes:

- **Spring Boot** for the backend (Model + Controller)
- **Vue.js** and **Node.js** for the frontend (View)

This submission represents **Stage 1 of the technical review**, as per the course requirements. A full implementation was not required by the instructor for this phase of the project.
